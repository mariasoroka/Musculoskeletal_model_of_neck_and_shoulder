# Musculoskeletal model of neck and shoulder
Supplementary materials for my bachelor thesis.
## Overview
The goal of this work was to create a musculoskeletal model of neck and shoulder in OpenSim [[1]](#1). Such a model is useful to analyze how 
shoulder traumas affect neck muscles. These insights could help to treat patients with neck pain.

This model was built as a union of two already existing models: [[2]](#2) and [[3]](#3). Then Motion Capture data were collected for different 
shoulder movements and was used to scale the generic model.

A detailed description of two models (generic and scaled) and of all the supplementary materials is available in documentation (in Russian) included in this repository.

The work was conducted under the supervision of [Victoria Salamatova](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Victoria-Salamatova-2) in Marchuk Institute of Numerical
Mathematics of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
